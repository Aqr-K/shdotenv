**Which dotenv is not compatible with?**

Only incompatibilities with other dotenv implementations will be fixed (except for `posix` dialect).

**Why do we need that compatibility?**

Since there is no official specification for the syntax of .env, we do not aim for full compatibility. If possible, please modify .env.
